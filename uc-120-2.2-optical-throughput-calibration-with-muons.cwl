label: Optical throughput measurements via muon ring analysis
doc: >
    Upon receiving a new DL0 data product (from either Monte Carlo simulations or observations), DPPS triggers the CalibPipe
    (ctapipe-process) to process the data using ctapipe, extracting the signal charges and reconstructing muon parameters.
    The second step involves using the CalibPipe tool to estimate the telescopeâ€™s optical throughput using a
    predefined number of muon events.
